"""
	This Python script is written by Zhiyang Ong to torture the
		boilerplate code.
	
	It does this by running a set of test cases on the boilerplate.
	
	To ensure that the boilerplate code can also run on the current
		software platform, including the operating system and software
		development libraries (e.g., Boost C++) as well as external
		tools for optimization, verification, validation, and testing.
	That is, test all the miscellaneous test code to try out various
		C++ concepts, C++ libraries, C++ -based tools, and hybrid
		integration of C++ code with code in other computer languages.
	E.g., test the use of integrating C++ and Python using
		Boost Python and SWIG, separately.
	E.g., test the use of using Scala to (partially) automate parser
		generation (or compiler generation).

	Also, as a precautionary measure, ensure that all LaTeX documents
		in the boilerplate code base can be typeset, so that users of
		the boilerplate code base can typeset the documents and view
		the result PDF documents for further information.

	Lastly, it shall remove all temporary files generated in the
		process.

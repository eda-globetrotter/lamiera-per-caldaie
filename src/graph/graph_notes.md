## Directed graph

### Data structures for directed graphs
AND-inverter graphs, AIGs
binary decision diagrams, BDDs
binary search trees
trees
directed acyclic graphs, DAGs




### Algorithms for directed graphs
topological sort
reverse topological sort
A*







## Undirected graph

### Data structures for undirected graphs


### Algorithms for undirected graphs
minimum spanning trees: Prim-Jarnik algorithm, and Kruskal's algorithm
longest increasing subsequence problem
shortest common subsequence problem; see common subexpression elimination











## From the sandbox, the following shortcuts are being used.
int_set
pair_intboolp_bool
node_set
pair_nodesetp_bool
node_set_p





## Data Structure Representations for Graphs

### Operations that I care about:
+ add()
+ remove()
+ search()
+ size()
+ empty()
+ begin()
+ end()






### Adjacency List



### Adjacency Matrix

Adjacency matrix: for sparse graphs, it takes up a lot of space


### Edge List

Keep an unordered list of all edges.
+ different to find a given edge, (u,v)
+ different to find a set of all edges incident to a

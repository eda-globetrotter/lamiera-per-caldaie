# lamiera-per-caldaie


Boilerplate code for my open source software projects. It will include implementations of common data structures and algorithms, including those for electronic design automation (such as AND-Inverter Graphs and Binary Decision Diagrams)



## Currently Implemented Data Structures and Algorithms
- Stack













## Organization of the Repository
- benchmarks: Benchmarks (synthetic) or otherwise
- binaries: Build and run software here.
- docs:
	* Automatically generated API (using *Doxygen*) for software in *HTML*.
- notes:
	* Software license(s).
	* Software documentation for project, written in *LaTeX*.
	* Guidelines for collaborating on open source software and/or hardware projects.
	* *BibTeX* database for the documentation.
- README.md: Readme file to describe the software project, and organization of the repository.
- scripts: Scripts to perform miscellaneous tasks for the software project.
- src: Source code of the software project, including test suites for automated regression testing.







## Building Static Binaries for Boilerplate Code

UNIX command for determining if a binary is statically linked: ldd <binary>. If dynamic libraries show up, the binary/software is not statically linked. 

Produce statically linked binaries to meet requirements of research contests.

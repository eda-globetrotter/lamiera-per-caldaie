# To-Do List for Developing my Boilerplate Code Base


- Refactor the Utility package
	+ Add "const" to all the accessor functions in the classes.
	+ Clean up the class for converting numbers to strings.
	+ Test the performance measurement class to determine which
		method is better for measure the temporal performance of
		the implemented methods.
		That is, try different ways to determine how long does it
		take to implement each function.
		Report which method is the best way of measuring the
		temporal performance of the implemented methods.



- Test graph module.
- Test parser module.
	+ Use ISPD contest parser.
	+ Implement with:
		- flex/bison
		- lex/yacc

- Refactor other packages.
	+ Add "const" to all the accessor functions in the classes.












- Develop STA and SSTA code in the boilerplate code base.
- Fork the code base for the STA and SSTA into separate repositories.
	+ The code base for the STA and SSTA timers should be dependent
		on the boilerplate code base.
- Finish the robust linear programming test cases.
	- Finish the testing linear programming engine.





- **Whenver I commit code, I should do automated regression testing.**
- Use *make test* for automated regression testing.
- Use *make torture* for automated regression testing of the
	boilerplate code and the "micro" test suites in the *sandbox*.

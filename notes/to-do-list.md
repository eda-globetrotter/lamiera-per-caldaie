	+ Clean up


- Refactor other packages.
	+ Add "const" to all the accessor functions in the classes.









- Develop STA and SSTA code in the boilerplate code base.
- Fork the code base for the STA and SSTA into separate repositories.
	+ The code base for the STA and SSTA timers should be dependent
		on the boilerplate code base.





- *Whenver I commit code, I should do automated regression testing.*

\section{Robust Linear Programming}
\label{sec:RobustLinearProgramming}


During the ``lab meeting'' on Friday, December 4, 2015, Prof. Jiang Hu told me that I can transform a robust linear programming into a standard/``standard'' linear programming problem. He told me to look at the references in 

Some of the mathematical programming solvers, including linear programming solvers, are: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item \cite{Innovation24Staff2015}: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Hybrid solver for optimization problems
	\item ``Next-generation, hybrid mathematical programming solver'' \cite[Product: Overview]{Innovation24Staff2015}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
